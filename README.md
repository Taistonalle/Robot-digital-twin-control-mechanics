# Robot-digital-twin-control-mechanics
This repository is part of a course in Turku University of Applied Sciences

Our goal in the course is to research different controlling methods for digital robot arm. Such as voice recognition, hand-tracking and more traditional controls like PlayStation/Xbox controller.
We used https://github.com/rparak/Unity3D_ABB_CRB_15000_GoFa_EGM repository files as our starting point.
